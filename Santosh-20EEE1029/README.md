## Challenge I faced
1. It was challenging to implement React Router to handle navigation and render various portfolio sections on the same page (navbar). Later, the router's use, which was of a different version, was fixed.
2. ![image](https://github.com/Santoshmourya05/Portfolio-Website-Challenge-Summer-2023/assets/110036735/24ba9a33-b3a9-4139-b475-742a8dd72452)

3. Attempted to make the app responsive for mobile phones with screen sizes up to 320px ensures that the portfolio maintains a visually appealing and functional layout on smaller devices. By optimizing the design for these screens, to ensure that users can easily access and navigate the portfolio regardless of the device they use.![image](https://github.com/Santoshmourya05/Portfolio-Website-Challenge-Summer-2023/assets/110036735/7de0a90d-e195-4f09-a774-f2b933787630)
