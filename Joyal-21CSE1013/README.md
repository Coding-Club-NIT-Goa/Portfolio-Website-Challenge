#About the Website
index.html is the start page.

This website is made using HTML, CSS ,JS ,Bootstrap and JQuery only. 

When the projects link on the home page is pressed, the page scrolls down to the projects section.

#NOTE!:
All of the text written in the projects section is false. I needed a lot of text to make the website look good and I havent done any major projects yet so I decided to use false text.
